## Overview

Integration settings manage the third-party services that are available across a reseller's portfolio. Some integrations require API keys or credentials to be configured at the reseller level before companies can enable them — the reseller provides the platform-level credentials, and companies configure their own integration-specific settings.

This two-level approach means:
- **Reseller administrators** set up shared credentials and API keys (e.g. a Google Maps API key) once
- **Company administrators** enable individual integrations from their admin settings and configure company-specific options

Integrations also depend on [feature flags](/topics/feature-flags) — the relevant feature flag must be enabled on both the reseller and the company before an integration can be activated.

## Available Integrations

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Platform Service Integrations

These integrations are configured at the reseller level and provide shared services across all companies.

| Integration | Reseller Setting | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Google Maps** | Google Maps JavaScript API key | Enables dynamic maps on event pages, custom map themes, and multi-marker event browse pages. Without dynamic maps, the platform uses static map images |
| **what3words** | what3words API key | Enables what3words address format as an alternative to traditional addresses |
| **Misr SMS** | Misr SMS credentials (API key + sender name) | Companies can use the reseller's Misr SMS account for order approval/rejection notifications |
| **VATstack** | VATstack secret key | Provides VAT compliance validation for EU transactions |

### Social Login Integrations

Social login credentials are configured at the reseller level to enable customers to sign in using third-party accounts.

| Provider | Credentials Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Facebook** | Client ID, client secret |
| **Google** | Client ID, client secret |
| **Twitter** | Client ID, client secret |
| **Apple** | Client ID, private key, private key ID, team ID |

When social login credentials are configured on the reseller, companies under that reseller can offer social login to their customers during checkout and account registration.

## How Integrations Flow from Reseller to Company

Integration enablement follows a three-step chain:

```
1. Reseller provides credentials / API keys (where required)

2. Feature flag enabled on reseller → then on company
   └── Company can now access the integration

3. Company administrator enables and configures the integration
```

Each step must be complete before the next is available. A company cannot enable an integration unless:
- The reseller has provided any required credentials
- The relevant feature flag is enabled on both the reseller and the company
- The company has the necessary permissions

<Note>
If a child company has **global transactions** enabled with its parent, integration settings that relate to payment processing are managed through the parent company's configuration.
</Note>

## Integration Conflicts

Some integrations are mutually exclusive and cannot be active on the same company at the same time:

| Integration | Conflicts With |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Szamlazz** | Conditional tax bands |
| **Refund Protect Group** | Manual Refund Protection |
| **Manual Refund Protection** | Refund Protect Group |

These conflicts are enforced through the feature flag system. Enabling one automatically prevents the conflicting option from being enabled.
