## Overview

Reseller fees are the charges applied to each transaction on the platform. They are configured in the hub and determine how much revenue the reseller collects from each sale made by its companies.

Fees are configured per item type — tickets, products, guest lists, and so on — and can vary by sales channel, currency, and item price. Each fee combines a percentage and a fixed amount, with optional minimum and maximum caps.

There are three levels of fee configuration:

1. **Reseller defaults** — baseline fees that apply to all companies under the reseller unless overridden.
2. **Plan fees** — fees defined on a [plan](/topics/plans-and-packages). Companies assigned to a plan can inherit its fees automatically.
3. **Company fees** — fees set directly on an individual company, either manually or synced from a plan.

## Fee Types

Fees can be configured for the following item types:

| Fee Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ticket fees** | Ticket sales |
| **Product fees** | Physical product sales |
| **Guest list fees** | Guest list entries |
| **Donation fees** | Charity donations |
| **Season ticket fees** | Season ticket sales |
| **Wallet top-up fees** | Account balance top-ups |
| **EPOS product fees** | EPOS product sales |
| **Fee item fees** | Custom fee items |
| **Fulfilment fees** | Fulfilment charge items |
| **Gift voucher fees** | Gift voucher sales |
| **Refund protection fees** | Automatic refund protection items |
| **Manual refund protection fees** | Manual refund protection items |
| **Bundle fees** | Bundle sales |
| **Resale fees** | Ticket resale transactions |
| **Gateway fees** | Payment gateway processing — see [blended fees](#blended-gateway-fees) |

## How Fees Are Calculated

Each fee is defined by four values:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Percent** | A percentage of the item's base price |
| **Fixed** | A fixed amount added on top of the percentage |
| **Min** | The minimum fee charged, regardless of calculation |
| **Max** | The maximum fee charged, regardless of calculation |

The formula is:

```
fee = (base_price × percent) + fixed
```

If the result falls below the minimum, the minimum is used. If it exceeds the maximum, the maximum is used. Min and max are not available for gateway fees.

### Fee Rounding

The rounding method is configured on the reseller fees page and controls how calculated fees are rounded to the nearest minor currency unit. It applies to all reseller fee calculations across the reseller's companies.

| Method | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Always round up** | Rounds up to the next unit (default) |
| **Round naturally** | Standard mathematical rounding |
| **Round down** | Rounds down to the previous unit |

## Sales Channels

Most fee types can be configured with different rates per sales channel. If no channel-specific fee is set, the default fee for that type is used.

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default** | Applies when no channel-specific fee is configured |
| **Online** | Sales made through the ticket shop |
| **Box Office** | Sales made through box office mode |
| **Kiosk** | Sales made through kiosk mode (only available when the company has the kiosk feature enabled) |

EPOS product fees only support the box office channel.

## Price Bands

For most fee types, fees can be broken into price bands — ranges of item price that each have their own fee configuration. This allows different fee rates depending on the value of the item being sold.

For example, a reseller might charge 5% on items priced up to £50 and 3% on items above £50.

Price bands are not available for gateway fees or EPOS product fees.

## Blended Gateway Fees

Gateway fees represent the payment processing cost (e.g. Stripe's percentage and fixed fee). By default, the gateway fee is calculated separately and stacked on top of the reseller fee. This means the gateway's fixed fee (e.g. £0.20) is applied to every item individually.

When **blended fees** are enabled on a gateway fee, the gateway fee is folded into the reseller fee instead. The fixed portion of the gateway fee is allocated proportionally across all blended items in the order, rather than being charged per item. This prevents overcharging the fixed fee when a basket contains multiple items.

<Note>
Blending is only available for gateway fees. Other fee types do not support blending.
</Note>

<Warning>
Blended fees work best when the processor charges a truly fixed rate. Most processors (e.g. Stripe) charge different rates depending on card type and region — for example, 1.4% + 20p for UK domestic cards but 2.5% + 20p for European cards. Because the platform applies a single configured rate to all transactions, any variance between the configured rate and the actual processor charge affects the reseller's revenue. The platform also records fees at the configured rate, which can make settlement reconciliation with the processor more difficult. Unless your processing costs are genuinely fixed, keeping gateway fees non-blended is generally the safer option.
</Warning>

## Fee Inheritance

### From Reseller Defaults

When a company is first created under a reseller, it starts with no fees. Reseller default fees serve as the baseline — they are copied to companies when fees are initially configured.

### From Plans

A [plan](/topics/plans-and-packages) can have its own set of default fees. When a company is set to use plan fees, its fees are synced from the plan automatically. Changes to the plan's fees are reflected on the company.

### Company Overrides

Fees can also be set directly on a company, independent of any plan. Companies with custom fees manage their own fee configuration without inheriting from the plan.

## Multi-Currency Support

Fees are configured per currency. If a reseller's companies sell in multiple currencies, fees must be configured for each currency individually. The fee table in the hub provides currency tabs for switching between configurations.

For companies using [custom currencies](https://docs.nuwebgroup.com/core-platform/epos/custom-currencies), only the fixed fee amount is used — percentage-based calculations are not applied. The fee falls back to the company's default currency configuration, using just the fixed amount.

## Fee Absorption

Companies can choose to absorb fees into their item prices, so the customer does not see them as a separate line item. This is controlled per sale item on the pricing configuration:

- **Absorb reseller fee** — the reseller fee is included in the displayed price rather than added on top.
- **Absorb processing fee** — the gateway/processing fee is included in the displayed price.

<Note>
A [limitation](/topics/feature-flags#limitations) exists to prevent companies from absorbing fees: **Disallow absorbing item fees**. When enabled, companies cannot hide reseller or processing fees in their pricing.
