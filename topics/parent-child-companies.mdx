description: "Link companies into parent-child hierarchies so they can share customers, centralise transactions, and list each other's events."

## Overview

Parent-child companies let you organise related companies into a single-level hierarchy. A parent company can manage data across its children, list their events alongside its own, and optionally share customer accounts and payment processing.

This is useful when:
- An organisation runs multiple brands or venues, each with its own company, but wants a unified customer experience across all of them.
- A venue operator needs separate companies for different departments (e.g. events vs. hospitality) while centralising sales and reporting under one parent.
- A group of related companies needs to share customer accounts and present a combined event catalogue without merging into a single company.

Parent-child relationships are configured in the Partner Hub when creating or editing a company, or programmatically via the Partner API.

## How It Works

Every company exists in one of three states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Standalone** | No parent, no children. Operates independently. |
| **Parent** | Has one or more child companies. Cannot itself have a parent. |
| **Child** | Linked to exactly one parent company. Cannot have children of its own. |

The hierarchy is always **single-level** — a child company cannot itself be a parent. There are no grandchildren.

Both the parent and child must belong to the **same reseller**. When selecting available companies for a parent-child relationship, only companies within the same reseller are shown.

### What Parent Companies Can Do

When a company has children, it gains visibility across the family:

- **Events from child companies** appear alongside the parent's own events in the ticket shop and admin event listings.
- **Tags** from child companies are available when filtering events.

Parent companies always retain access to the **Sales** section in admin, regardless of other settings.

### Two Key Settings

Each child company has two settings that control how deeply it integrates with its parent:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Global Login">
    **Global login** allows customers to use the same credentials across the parent company and any child companies that have it enabled.

    When enabled:
    - A customer who registers on the parent company's shop can log in to the child company's shop (and vice versa).
    - Events from the child company can be browsed and purchased from the parent company's shop without redirecting.
    - Box office users on the parent company can process sales for the child company's events.

    When disabled:
    - The parent and child maintain **separate customer databases**.
    - Customers browsing a child company's event on the parent shop are redirected to the child company's own shop to complete the purchase.
    - Box office sales for the child company's events **must be processed in the child company's box office directly**, since the customer databases are separate.

    <Note>
    Global login must be enabled on **both** the parent and child for it to take effect. Enabling it on just one side has no effect.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Global Transactions">
    **Global transactions** centralise all sales and payment processing under the parent company. This is a deeper level of integration than global login alone.

    When enabled:
    - Sales and transactions for the child company are **managed by the parent company**.
    - The child company does not need its own payment providers — the parent's payment configuration is used.
    - The child company's **Sales** section in admin is hidden, since the parent handles all financial operations.
    - **Global login is automatically enabled**, because shared transactions require shared customer accounts.

    When disabled:
    - The child company manages its own sales, transactions, and payment providers independently.
    - Global login can be enabled or disabled separately.

    <Note>
    Global transactions can only be enabled when a parent company is assigned. Removing the parent automatically disables global transactions.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up a Parent-Child Relationship

Parent-child relationships are configured on the **company edit page** in the Partner Hub. The setup differs depending on whether you are designating a company as a parent or as a child.

### Creating a Parent Company

When creating or editing a company:

1. In the **System Settings** section, set the company type to **Parent Company**.
2. A **child company selector** appears, showing all available companies within the same reseller.
3. Select the companies that should become children.
4. For each selected child, configure:
   - **Global login** — whether customers are shared between this parent and the child.
   - **Global transactions** — whether the parent manages the child's sales and payments.
5. Click **Save**.

<Note>
Only standalone companies (those without an existing parent and without children of their own) appear as available children. A company that already has a parent assigned by a different company, or that is itself a parent, cannot be selected.
</Note>

### Creating a Child Company

When creating or editing a company:

1. In the **System Settings** section, set the company type to **Child Company**.
2. A **parent company selector** appears as a searchable dropdown.
3. Select the parent company.
4. Configure **Global login** and **Global transactions** settings for this child.
5. Click **Save**.

<Note>
A company that already has children cannot be made into a child. You must remove its children first.
</Note>

### Removing a Relationship

To remove a parent-child link:
- **From the parent side**: Edit the parent company and deselect the child from the child company selector. The child becomes a standalone company.
- **From the child side**: Edit the child company and clear the parent selection (set to **No parent**). Global transactions and global login are reset.

### Via the Partner API

Parent-child relationships can also be configured programmatically when creating or updating a company through the Partner API.

To designate a company as a **child**, include a `parent` object:

```json
{
  "parent": {
    "id": 123,
    "globalTransactions": false,
    "globalLogin": true
  }
}
```

To designate a company as a **parent**, include a `children` array:

```json
{
  "children": [
    {
      "id": 456,
      "globalTransactions": true,
      "globalLogin": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The `parent` and `children` fields cannot be used together in the same request. Both `globalTransactions` and `globalLogin` default to `false`. The same validation rules apply as in the Partner Hub UI.

<Note>
See the [Create Company](https://docs.nuwebgroup.com/partner-api-reference/companies/create-company) and [Update Company](https://docs.nuwebgroup.com/partner-api-reference/companies/update-company) endpoints for full details.
</Note>

## Modifying Global Settings

Changes to **global login** and **global transactions** are blocked when the child company has existing orders against its own sale items.

When this restriction applies, the toggles appear **disabled** in the UI with a warning message. This prevents inconsistencies — for example, switching a child to global transactions after it has already processed local payments would create conflicting financial records.

<Note>
This restriction is evaluated per child company. If a parent has three children, some may allow global setting changes while others do not, depending on whether each child has existing orders.
</Note>

### Automatic Behaviour When Toggling Global Transactions

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Enable global transactions | Global login is **automatically enabled** (transactions require shared customers). Payment provider settings on the child are no longer used. |
| Disable global transactions | The child company can now configure its own payment providers. Global login can be independently enabled or disabled. |
| Remove parent company | Both global transactions and global login are **reset to disabled**. |

## Effects on Platform Features

### Ticket Shop

Parent companies display events from their child companies alongside their own. How customers interact with these events depends on the global login setting:

| Global Login | Customer Experience |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Enabled** | Customers browse and purchase child company events directly from the parent's shop. No redirect occurs. |
| **Disabled** | Customers viewing a child company's event on the parent shop are **redirected to the child company's shop** to complete the purchase, since the customer databases are separate. |

### Box Office

| Global Login | Box Office Behaviour |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Enabled** | Box office users on the parent company can process sales for child company events. |
| **Disabled** | Sales for child company events must be processed in the child company's own box office. Attempting to process them from the parent shows: *"Sales for '[event name]' must be processed in the [company name] box office directly as they use a separate customer database (global login is disabled)."* |

### Seating Plans

Parent companies see an informational message on the seating plans page:

> *"Seating plans for any child events/companies must now be managed directly in the individual child company accounts."*

While events on the parent can reference seating plans from child companies, the plans themselves are created and edited within the child company's admin.

### Access Codes

Parent company admins can attach child company events, items, schedules, and sale items to their access codes. How those codes behave depends on which shop the customer is using:

| Shop | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Parent company shop** | The access code **works as expected** — it restricts or grants access to the attached child company items just as it would for the parent's own items. |
| **Child company shop** | The access code **has no effect**. Customers shopping directly on a child company's site will not be restricted by a parent company's access code. |

A warning is displayed in the admin when a parent company access code has items attached:

> *"This code will not restrict access to items, events, schedules or price bands via a child company shop."*

## Deletion and Restoration

Parent-child relationships affect the order in which companies can be deleted and restored:

| Action | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Deleting a parent** | Blocked while child companies exist. You must delete or reassign all children first. Message: *"Parent companies cannot be deleted before their children."* |
| **Restoring a child** | Blocked if the parent company is still deleted. You must restore the parent first. Message: *"Cannot restore child company of a deleted parent company. Please restore parent company first."* |
