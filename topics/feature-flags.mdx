title: "Feature Flags & Limitations"
description: "Enable, disable, and configure platform features and restrictions for companies."
---

## Overview

Feature flags control which platform capabilities are available to a company. They are managed from the company edit page in the hub, where features are organised into groups (Events, Shop, Websites, EPOS, Fees, System, Integrations, and more).

There are two types of flags:

- **Capabilities** — enable features or workflows (e.g. seating plans, access control, donations).
- **Limitations** — restrict or disable specific functionality (e.g. disallow box office mode, block editing historic events).

Some features can be toggled by company administrators themselves (**self-service**), while others can only be configured by platform administrators in the hub (**hub-operated**).

## Reseller Funnelling

Before a feature can be enabled on a company, it must first be enabled on the reseller that owns the company. The reseller acts as a funnel — only features that are active on the reseller will appear as available options when configuring a company or creating a plan under that reseller.

This funnelling pattern applies beyond feature flags. Currencies, countries, languages, and [payment gateways](/topics/gateway-settings) all work the same way: they must be enabled on the reseller before they can be assigned to any of its companies.

Enabling a feature on the reseller does not enable it on any company — it simply makes the feature available for assignment.

## How Features Are Assigned to Companies

Once a feature is available via the reseller, it can be assigned to a company in two ways:

**Directly** — toggle individual features on the company edit page. This gives full control over exactly which features a company has access to.

**Via a plan** — assign the company to a [plan](/topics/plans-and-packages) that has a predefined set of features. When a plan is assigned, its features are synced to the company automatically. A plan's available features are also funnelled through its reseller — only features the reseller has enabled can be added to the plan. Features assigned via a plan appear as read-only on the company edit page — removing them triggers a confirmation warning since it means deviating from the plan.

## Feature Modes

Some features support multiple modes, configured via a context selector that appears when the feature is enabled.

| Feature | Modes |
|---------|-------|
| **Seating plans** | Small plans only, Small and large plans |
| **Donations** | Donations only, Donations with Gift Aid |
| **Seating plan holds** | Seats only, Seats + general admissions |
| **Account balance refunds** | Admin only, Admin and self-serve |
| **Resale** | API only, Web only, Web and API |
| **Refund Protect Group** | Standard, Anonymous |

## Conflicts and Requirements

Some features depend on other features being enabled first, and some features are mutually exclusive.

**Requirements** — the feature cannot be enabled until its prerequisites are active. For example:
- **Seating plan holds** requires **Seating plans**
- **Lead capture** requires **Access control**
- **Custom currencies** requires **EPOS** and **Online account balances**
- **Gift vouchers** requires **Split payments** and **Online account balances**
- **Rolled up fees**, **Dynamic fees**, **Tiered fees**, and **Fee hierarchy control** all require **Custom fees**

**Conflicts** — only one of the conflicting features can be active at a time. For example:
- **GEA integration** conflicts with **Tawakkalna integration**
- **Szamlazz integration** conflicts with **Conditional tax bands**
- **Refund Protect Group** conflicts with **Manual Refund Protection**
- **All-in pricing** conflicts with **Conditional tax bands**

## Pre-Release Features

Features marked as pre-release (beta) are only visible to super users in the hub. These features are in active development and may change or be removed. They are indicated with a beta badge in both the hub and in the reference tables below.
