## Overview

Gateway settings control which payment processors are available across a reseller's portfolio of companies. Payment gateways are configured at the reseller level and then assigned to individual companies — a company can only use gateways that its reseller has enabled.

This follows the same [reseller funnelling](/topics/feature-flags#reseller-funnelling) pattern as feature flags: gateways must be enabled on the reseller before they can be assigned to any of its companies.

## Supported Gateways

The platform supports a wide range of payment processors. Gateways fall into two categories based on where their credentials are managed.

### Reseller-Managed Gateways

These gateways have their credentials configured once at the reseller level. Companies connect to the reseller's account — the specifics of how this works depend on the gateway.

| Gateway |
|---------|
| **Stripe** |
| **SumUp** |
| **PayPal** |
| **Ryft** |
| **Curlec** |
| **Nuvei** |

### Company-Managed Gateways

All other gateways require credentials to be configured at the company level. The reseller enables the gateway (making it available), but each company provides its own merchant credentials.

| Gateway | | |
|---------|---------|---------|
| QuickPay | PayTabs | Authorize.Net |
| Barclays ePDQ | SimplePay | Tap |
| Adyen | Pay Retailers | DPO Pay |
| ONVO | Netpay | Transbank |
| PowerTranz | Bloomin | M-Pesa |
| HyperPay | Banorte | Worldpay |
| Revolut | | |

<Note>
The platform also uses internal gateway types (e-wallet and balance-on-hand) for account balance payments, but these are not configurable as payment gateways — they are managed through feature flags.
</Note>

## How Gateways Are Assigned

### Reseller Configuration

Gateways are assigned to resellers during reseller setup or editing. Each reseller maintains a list of enabled gateways, along with any reseller-level credentials for reseller-managed gateways.

### Company Configuration

When creating or editing a company in the hub, the gateway assignment step shows only the gateways enabled on the company's reseller. Companies can be assigned one or more gateways.

Each company gateway has several configuration options:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Credentials** | Gateway-specific merchant credentials (for company-managed gateways) |
| **Enabled in shop** | Whether the gateway is available for online transactions in the ticket shop |
| **Enabled in box office** | Whether the gateway is available for box office transactions |
| **Primary (shop)** | The default gateway used for shop transactions when multiple gateways are enabled |
| **Primary (box office)** | The default gateway used for box office transactions when multiple gateways are enabled |

<Note>
When a gateway is disabled for a sales channel, and it was the primary gateway for that channel, the next enabled gateway is automatically promoted to primary.
</Note>

### During Self-Service Registration

Companies created through [self-service registration](/topics/self-service-registration) are automatically assigned the reseller's first available payment gateway. The registering user does not select a gateway — it is inherited from the reseller.

## Gateway Credentials

### Reseller-Level Credentials

For reseller-managed gateways, credentials are configured at the reseller level. Companies connect to the reseller's account, though some gateways may have additional configuration options at the company level.

### Company-Level Credentials

For company-managed gateways, each company provides its own credentials. The specific fields vary by gateway but typically include API keys, merchant IDs, and secrets.

Companies can view and update their gateway credentials from their admin **Payment settings** page. Some gateways also support additional credential fields such as:

- **MOTO enabled** — allows mail order / telephone order transactions
- **Terminal enabled** — supports card-present payments via connected terminals

### Self-Managed Payment Mode

The **Company self manage payment mode** feature flag controls whether companies can switch their own gateway between live and test modes. When enabled, companies can toggle between modes from their admin settings without hub intervention.

## Gateway Requirements

Some gateways impose additional requirements on the checkout experience:

| Requirement | Gateways |
|-------------|----------|
| **Billing address required** | PayTabs, Pay Retailers, Netpay, Bloomin, Banorte, Nuvei |
| **Phone number required** | Netpay |

When a gateway with these requirements is enabled for a company, the corresponding data capture fields are automatically set to mandatory in the company's checkout settings.

## Gateways and Parent-Child Companies

Gateway configuration interacts with the [parent-child company](/topics/parent-child-companies) hierarchy:

| Setting | Gateway Behaviour |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Global transactions enabled** | The child company uses the **parent company's** payment configuration. The child does not need its own gateway credentials |
| **Global transactions disabled** | The child company manages its own gateways independently |

## Webhook Configuration

Some gateways support webhooks for receiving real-time payment status updates from the processor. For gateways that require webhooks:

- The webhook URL is generated automatically based on the gateway type and the reseller's domain
- Webhook events are configured per gateway during reseller setup
- The platform handles webhook signature verification and routing internally
