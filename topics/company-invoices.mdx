## Overview

Company invoices are how resellers bill their companies for platform usage — primarily the [reseller fees](/topics/reseller-fees) collected on each transaction. Invoices are managed from the hub and can be created manually or generated automatically based on fee data.

Companies can view their invoices from their admin panel. If online billing is enabled, they can also pay invoices directly.

<Note>
Company invoices are not related to [invoice payments](https://docs.nuwebgroup.com/core-platform/payments/invoice-payments). Invoice payments are a checkout method that allows ticket buyers to confirm an order without immediate card payment. Company invoices, by contrast, are documents issued by the reseller to bill a company for fees owed.

## Creating Invoices Manually

Invoices can be created manually from the hub for any company. Each invoice includes:

- **Company** and **currency**
- **Reference** — auto-suggested based on the last invoice for the reseller, but can be overridden
- **Date issued** and **date due**
- **Type** — Invoice, Credit Note, or Proforma (see [invoice types](#invoice-types))
- **Line items** — one or more entries, each with a label and price
- **Notes** — optional text appended to the invoice (e.g. payment terms or bank details)

Invoice PDFs can either be generated automatically from the invoice data or uploaded manually as a file.

## Automatic Fee Invoicing

Automatic fee invoicing generates invoices from the [reseller fees](/topics/reseller-fees) collected on transactions. When enabled, the system periodically groups uninvoiced fees by company and currency, creates an invoice with line items broken down by payment method, item type, and gateway, and links those fees to the generated invoice.

Fee invoicing is configured on the reseller fees page under **Fee invoicing settings**. These settings act as defaults for all companies under the reseller. Individual companies can override the settings or inherit the reseller defaults.

### Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Invoicing method** | **Cash** — invoices are generated based on when fees are settled/paid out. **Accrual** — invoices are generated based on the transaction date. Changing from cash to accrual is permanent and cannot be reversed. |
| **Invoice type** | The type of document to generate (Invoice or Proforma). |
| **Frequency** | **Monthly** (generated on the 1st of each month) or **Weekly** (generated on a chosen anchor day). |
| **Payment methods** | Which payment methods to include. A separate line item is added for each enabled payment method. |
| **Payment terms** | Number of days from the issue date until payment is due. |
| **Start date** | Only fees on transactions dated on or after this date are invoiced. |
| **Invoice notes** | Default notes appended to generated invoices. |

### Company-Level Overrides

By default, companies inherit the reseller's fee invoicing settings. To customise settings for a specific company, disable **Inherit reseller default settings** on the company's fees page and configure the settings independently.

## Invoice Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Invoice** | A standard payable invoice. |
| **Credit Note** | A non-payable credit adjustment. |
| **Proforma** | A payable preliminary invoice. |

## Billing Details

Both the reseller and company can configure billing details that appear on invoices:

- **Reseller** — billing name, address, tax number, phone, and email. These appear as the "from" details on invoices.
- **Company** — billing name, address, and sales tax number. These appear as the "to" details.

## Online Billing

When the **Online billing** feature is enabled for a company, invoices can be paid directly from the company's admin panel. Companies can select one or more unpaid invoices and pay them by card. The payment is processed through the reseller's Stripe account, with funds settling directly to the reseller.

From the hub, platform administrators can also collect payment on an invoice directly.

Without online billing, invoices must be settled offline (e.g. bank transfer) and marked as paid manually in the hub.

## Overdue Invoice Enforcement

The **Block company access when invoice(s) overdue** [limitation](/topics/feature-flags#limitations) can be enabled to restrict access for companies with overdue invoices. When active:

- If online billing is enabled, the company is redirected to their invoices page to pay.
- If online billing is not enabled, the company is locked out entirely until the reseller marks the invoice as paid.

An invoice is considered overdue when it is unpaid and past its due date.
