## Overview

Self-service registration lets new companies create their own accounts on the platform without a hub administrator manually setting them up. Prospective users complete a three-step registration form that collects their personal details, business information, and event profile. Once submitted, the platform automatically creates a user account, a new company, and configures defaults — the new user is logged in and taken straight to creating their first event.

This is useful for resellers that want to:
- Scale onboarding without manual intervention for each new company
- Collect structured information about prospective customers up front
- Automatically apply a standard plan with predefined features and fees to new sign-ups

## How It Works

Self-service registration is controlled at the reseller level. When enabled, a registration form becomes available at `admin.<reseller-domain>/register` (the `admin` subdomain is the default, but this prefix is customisable per reseller). The form is a three-step wizard that creates everything needed for the new company to start using the platform immediately.

### What Gets Created

When a user completes registration, the platform automatically provisions:

| Resource | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **User account** | Name, email, phone, and password as provided in the form |
| **Company** | Named after the business, with an auto-generated site alias |
| **Company settings** | Business contact details, timezone, and event questionnaire answers |
| **Default configuration** | One currency, one language, one country, and one payment gateway — all inherited from the reseller |
| **User role** | The reseller's default company role, or full admin access to their new company if no default role is configured |
| **Plan assignment** | If a default registration plan is configured and the plans feature is enabled, the plan's features and fees are applied |

### Registration Flow

```
1. User visits the registration page
   └── Form shows if at least one reseller has registration enabled

2. Step 1: Account Details
   └── Name, email, phone, password, reseller selection, agreements

3. Step 2: Business Details
   └── Business name, alias, contact details, country, currency, language

4. Step 3: Event Details
   └── Event volume, ticket volume, pricing, event types, deadline

5. Form submitted
   └── User account created
   └── Company created with defaults from reseller
   └── Plan assigned (if configured)
   └── Emails sent (if configured)
   └── User logged in and redirected to create first event
```

## Enabling Registration

Self-service registration requires two things:

1. **Registration setting** — The **Registration** setting must be enabled on the reseller. This is a reseller-level setting that controls whether the reseller accepts new sign-ups.

2. **Reseller configuration** — The reseller must have at least one currency, language, country, and payment gateway configured, as these provide the defaults for new companies.

When no reseller has registration enabled, the registration page displays a **Registration is disabled** message.

## The Registration Form

### Step 1: Account Details

The first step collects the user's personal credentials and legal agreements.

| Field | Required | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Your name** | Yes | Full name of the person registering |
| **Your email** | Yes | Must be unique across both the admin and hub systems |
| **Your phone** | Yes | Country code selector plus phone number |
| **Password** | Yes | Minimum 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character |
| **Password confirmation** | Yes | Must match password |
| **Which reseller?** | Conditional | Only shown when multiple resellers with the same domain have registration enabled |
| **Terms & conditions** | Yes | Checkbox linking to the reseller's configured terms URL |
| **Privacy policy** | Yes | Checkbox linking to the reseller's configured privacy URL |
| **Marketing opt-in** | No | Opt-in for product updates and newsletters |

<Note>
The marketing opt-in text reads: *"I'd like to be the first to know about the latest product updates."* Users can unsubscribe later from their admin profile settings.
</Note>

### Step 2: Business Details

The second step captures the company information that will be used to create the new company.

| Field | Required | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Business name** | Yes | Becomes the company name |
| **Business alias** | Auto-generated | Auto-created from the business name (kebab-case). Editable before submission. Help text: *"Requested site URL (can be changed later)"* |
| **Business email** | No | Defaults to the user's email if left blank. Help text: *"if different from admin email"* |
| **Business phone** | No | Defaults to the user's phone if left blank. Help text: *"if different from admin phone"* |
| **Business website** | No | Optional website URL |
| **Selling country** | Yes | Selected from the reseller's available countries |
| **Currency** | Yes | Selected from the reseller's available currencies |
| **Language** | Yes | Selected from the reseller's available languages |
| **Default timezone** | Auto-populated | Set automatically based on the selected country. Can be changed manually |

### Step 3: Event Details

The final step collects information about the registrant's event profile. This data is stored as questionnaire answers and included in the notification email sent to the reseller — it does not affect company configuration.

| Field | Required | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Number of events per year** | Yes | Range selector: 0, Under 10, 10–100, 100–1,000, 1,000+ |
| **Ticket sales per year** | Yes | Range selector: 0, Under 2,500, 2,500–10,000, 10,000–25,000, 25,000+ |
| **Average ticket price** | Yes | Free text |
| **What type of events** | No | Free text description |
| **Implementation deadline** | Yes | Either **As soon as possible** (default) or **I have a deadline** with a date picker |

## Default Configuration

New companies inherit their initial configuration from the reseller. Understanding what gets applied automatically helps when setting up a reseller for self-service registration.

### Currency, Language, and Country

The registration form lets the user choose one currency, one language, and one country from the options available on the reseller. These become the company's initial configuration.

### Payment Gateway

The company is assigned the reseller's first payment gateway automatically. The user does not select a gateway during registration.

### Timezone

If the user does not explicitly set a timezone, the company inherits the reseller's default timezone.

### User Role

The role assigned to the new user depends on the reseller's configuration:

| Reseller setting | Role assigned |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Default company role** is configured | The user receives the specified restricted role |
| **No default role** configured | The user receives full admin (super user) access |

### Plan Assignment

If the reseller has a **default registration plan** configured and the **Plans** feature flag is enabled, the plan is automatically assigned to the new company during registration. This includes syncing the plan's features and fees to the company.

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Plans feature enabled + default plan set | Plan assigned, features and fees synced |
| Plans feature enabled + no default plan set | No plan assigned |
| Plans feature enabled + default plan archived or deleted | No plan assigned |
| Plans feature disabled | No plan assigned, regardless of setting |

See [Plans & Packages](/topics/plans-and-packages) for details on configuring plans.

## Notification Emails

Registration can trigger two types of email notification, both configurable independently.

### Company Registration Notification

When the **signup email list** is configured on the reseller settings, each email address in the list receives a notification whenever a new company registers. The email contains:

- The registrant's name, email, and phone number
- Business details: name, email, phone, website, country, currency, and language
- Event questionnaire answers from Step 3
- A direct link to view the new company in the hub


<Note>
If no signup email addresses are configured, registration still works — the notification is simply not sent. Configure the email list in reseller settings to stay informed about new sign-ups.
</Note>

<Accordion title="Welcome Email (currently unavailable)">
  <Warning>
  Welcome emails are currently unavailable and will be enabled in a future release.
  </Warning>

  An optional welcome email can be sent to the new company administrator after registration. This email introduces them to the platform and includes a direct link to their admin portal.

  Once available, the **Send welcome emails on self-service registration** setting must be enabled in reseller settings.

  The email subject follows the format: *"Welcome to [Reseller Name] [Company Name]!"*
</Accordion>

## Reseller Settings Reference
