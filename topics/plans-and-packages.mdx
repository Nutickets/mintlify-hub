## Overview

Plans are reusable configuration templates that bundle together a set of [feature flags](/topics/feature-flags) and [reseller fees](/topics/reseller-fees). Instead of manually configuring each company's features and fees individually, you can create a plan once and assign it to multiple companies — all of which then share the same configuration.

This is useful when:
- You have tiers of service (e.g. basic, professional, enterprise) with different feature sets and fee structures
- You want to ensure consistent configuration across companies with the same offering
- You need to update features or fees for a group of companies at once rather than editing each one individually
- You use [self-service registration](/topics/self-service-registration) and want new companies to receive a standard configuration automatically

Plans are managed per reseller and require the **Plans** feature flag to be enabled on the reseller.

## How Plans Work

A plan has three components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | A label to identify the plan (e.g. "Standard", "Enterprise") |
| **Features** | The set of feature flags that companies on this plan receive |
| **Usage fees** | The reseller fee schedule (per currency and fee type) that companies on this plan are charged |

Plans also support optional settings such as an **event timeslots limit** that restricts the maximum number of timeslots a company can create per event.

### Reseller Funnelling

A plan can only include features that its reseller has enabled. This follows the same [reseller funnelling](/topics/feature-flags#reseller-funnelling) pattern as direct feature assignment — the reseller acts as a gate, and the plan can only pass through what the reseller allows.

If a feature is later disabled on the reseller, it will no longer be available when editing the plan.

### Assigning a Plan to a Company

Plans are assigned on the company edit page or during company creation in the hub. When a plan is assigned:

1. **Features** from the plan are synced to the company. Features that came from the plan appear as read-only on the company's feature flag list.
2. **Fees** from the plan are optionally synced to the company (controlled by the **Use plan fees** setting on the company).
3. **Settings** from the plan (e.g. event timeslots limit) are applied to the company.

A company can only be assigned to one plan at a time. Assigning a different plan replaces the previous one.

<Note>
Removing a feature that was assigned via a plan triggers a confirmation warning, since it means the company is deviating from its plan's standard configuration.
</Note>

## Creating a Plan

Plans are created from the reseller's plans page.

1. Navigate to the reseller's **Plans** section
2. Click **Add new plan**
3. Enter the plan **name**
4. Configure **usage fees** — set the fee schedule per currency and fee type. This works the same as configuring [reseller fees](/topics/reseller-fees) but scoped to this plan
5. Configure **features** — toggle the features that companies on this plan should receive. Only features available on the reseller are shown
6. Click **Save**

The plan is now available for assignment to companies.

<Note>
Plans also support a **blended reseller** fee option per currency. When blended fees are enabled, the reseller fee and gateway processing fee are combined into a single charge rather than being itemised separately.
</Note>

## Editing a Plan

When you edit a plan, changes propagate to all companies currently assigned to it. This is one of the key benefits of plans — update once, apply everywhere.

### Feature Changes

If you **add features** to a plan, those features are synced to all assigned companies.

If you **remove features** from a plan, a confirmation dialog appears showing:
- Which features are being removed
- Which companies are affected

After confirming, the removed features are deactivated on all assigned companies.

### Fee Changes

When fees are modified, you are asked how to apply the changes:

| Option | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| **Apply to all items (old and new)** | Fees are recalculated across all existing sale items for all companies on this plan |
| **Apply only to new/edited items** | Updated fees take effect only when new items are created or existing items are edited |

<Warning>
Choosing to apply fee changes to all items triggers a recalculation across every sale item for every company on the plan. For plans with many companies, this runs as a background job.
</Warning>

### Blended Fee Changes

If the **blended reseller** setting changes for any fee, all item fees for affected companies must be recalculated. This is enforced automatically — there is no option to defer it to new items only.

## Fees and Plans

Each company on a plan has a **Use plan fees** setting that controls whether the company inherits the plan's fee schedule:

| Setting | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| **Use plan fees** enabled | The company's fees are managed by the plan. The company fee table displays the plan's fees and shows: *"This company will inherit the fees configured in '[Plan Name]'."* Changes to the plan's fees automatically propagate to the company |
| **Use plan fees** disabled | The company maintains its own independent fee schedule. Plan fee changes do not affect this company. The company fee table shows: *"This company will not inherit the fees configured in '[Plan Name]'."* |

A **Reset to plan fees** option is available for companies where plan fee inheritance has been disabled, allowing you to re-sync with the plan's current fee schedule.

<Note>
When a plan is first assigned to a company (including during [self-service registration](/topics/self-service-registration)), **Use plan fees** is enabled by default.
</Note>

## Archiving Plans

Plans can be archived to hide them from selection without affecting companies already using them.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Archive** | The plan is hidden from the plan selection dropdown when creating or editing companies. Companies already assigned to the plan remain on it and continue to receive updates |
| **Unarchive** | The plan reappears as an available option for assignment |

The archive tooltip explains: *"Archiving plans allows you to hide them as options when assigning to companies but keeps them assigned to any existing companies."*

Archiving is useful when you want to retire a plan for new companies while maintaining it for existing ones.

## Deleting a Plan

Deleting a plan removes it entirely and unlinks all companies:

1. All companies assigned to the plan are set to **Custom** configuration (no plan)
2. Companies **retain their current features and fees** — nothing is removed from them
3. The plan is soft-deleted and can be restored later

The confirmation message reads: *"Are you sure you want to delete "[Plan Name]"? All companies assigned to this plan will retain their fees and features but be set to "Custom"."*

### Restoring a Deleted Plan

Soft-deleted plans can be restored from the plans list by filtering for deleted plans and clicking **Restore**. Restoration makes the plan available for assignment again but does not re-assign it to any companies that were previously linked.

## Plans and Self-Service Registration

Plans integrate with [self-service registration](/topics/self-service-registration) through the **default registration plan** setting on the reseller. When configured:

- New companies that register through the self-service form are automatically assigned the default plan
- The plan's features and fees are applied to the new company immediately
- The **Plans** feature flag must be enabled on the reseller for this to take effect

If the default registration plan is archived, deleted, or the Plans feature flag is disabled, new registrations proceed without a plan assignment.

## The Plans List

The plans index page shows all plans for a reseller in a card-based grid layout. Each card displays:

- The plan **name**
- **Feature count** — e.g. *"12 feature(s)"*
- **Company count** — e.g. *"Assigned to 5 company(s)"*, with an expandable list of company names

Available actions per plan:
- **Edit** — modify the plan's name, features, and fees
- **Archive / Unarchive** — toggle visibility for new assignments
- **Delete** — remove the plan (with confirmation)

The list can be filtered by:
- **Name** — partial text match
- **Deleted status** — show or hide soft-deleted plans
- **Archived status** — hide archived, show all, or show only archived
