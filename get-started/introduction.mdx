The Partner Hub is the management layer that sits above the core platform. Resellers (the organisations that operate and distribute the platform) use it to configure and oversee the companies that use the [core platform](https://docs.nuwebgroup.com/core-platform/get-started/introduction).

## Key Concepts

### Resellers

A **reseller** is the top-level entity in the platform hierarchy. Each reseller manages a portfolio of companies and controls what's available to them. Everything flows down from the reseller: features, currencies, languages, payment gateways, and fee structures must all be enabled on the reseller before they can be assigned to any of its companies.

### Companies

A **company** is a tenant on the platform with its own events, customers, orders, and ticket shop. Companies are created and managed from the hub.

Companies can operate independently or be linked into [parent–child hierarchies](/topics/parent-child-companies), where a parent company gains visibility across its children's events, customers, and sales.

## What You Manage from the Hub

| Area | What it controls |
|------|-----------------|
| **[Feature flags & limitations](/topics/feature-flags)** | Which platform capabilities are available to each company, from seating plans to donations to box office mode. Features must be enabled on the reseller before they can be assigned. |
| **[Reseller fees](/topics/reseller-fees)** | The transaction fees charged to companies on each sale, broken down by item type, sales channel, and currency. |
| **[Company invoices](/topics/company-invoices)** | Billing companies for platform usage, either automatically from transaction data or manually for ad-hoc charges. |
| **[Parent–child companies](/topics/parent-child-companies)** | Linking companies into hierarchies so they can share customers, centralise transactions, and list each other's events. |
| **[Gateway settings](/topics/gateway-settings)** | Payment gateway configuration: which processors are available and how credentials are managed. |
| **[Plans & packages](/topics/plans-and-packages)** | Predefined bundles of features and fees that can be assigned to companies for consistent configuration. |
| **[Self-service registration](/topics/self-service-registration)** | Allowing new companies to sign up and onboard themselves without manual hub intervention. |
| **[Integration settings](/topics/integration-settings)** | Third-party integration configuration managed at the reseller level. |
